		<h4> Step 1: Identifying the Destination </h4>
	
		<p> Security <a href="#Internal security">Destination anchors</a>is the degree of resistance to, 
			or protection from, harm. It applies to any vulnerable and valuable 
			asset, such as a person, dwelling, community, item, nation, or organization.
			As noted by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM) in the OSSTMM 3, security provides 
			"a form of protection where a separation is created between the assets and the threat." These separations 
			are generically called "controls," and sometimes include changes to the asset or the threat.
			Security is said to have two dialogues. Negative dialogue is about danger, risk, threat etc. Positive 
			dialogue is about opportunities, interests, profits etc. Negative dialogue needs military equipment, 
			armies, or police. Positive dialogue needs social capital, education, or social interaction.
			Perceived security compared to real security[edit]
			Perception of security may be poorly mapped to measurable objective security. For example, the fear of 
			earthquakes has been reported to be more common than the fear of slipping on the bathroom floor although 
			the latter kills many more people than the former.[3] Similarly, the perceived effectiveness of security 
			measures is sometimes different from the actual security provided by those measures. The presence of security protections may even be taken for the safety itself. For example, two computer security programs could be interfering with each other and even canceling each other's effect, while the owner believes s/he is getting double the protection.
			Security theatre is a critical term for deployment of measures primarily aimed at raising subjective security without a genuine or commensurate concern for the effects of that action on real safety. For example, some consider the screening of airline passengers based on static databases to have been Security theater and the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System to have created a decrease in objective security.
			Perception of security can increase objective security when it affects or deters malicious behavior, as 
			with visual signs of security protections, such as video surveillance, alarm systems in a home, or an 
			anti-theft system in a car such as a vehicle tracking system or warning sign. Since some intruders will 
			decide not to attempt to break into such areas or vehicles, there can be less damage to windows in 
			addition to protection of valuable objects inside. Without such advertisement, an intruder might, for 
			example, approach a car, break the window, and then flee in response to an alarm being triggered. Either 
			way, perhaps the car itself and the objects inside aren't stolen, but with perceived security even the 
			windows of the car have a lower chance of being damaged.
			Categorizing security[edit]
			There is an immense literature on the analysis and categorization of security. Part of the reason for 
			this is that, in most security systems, the "weakest link in the chain" is the most important. The 
			situation is asymmetric since the 'defender' must cover all points of attack while the attacker need only 
			identify a single weak point upon which to concentrate.
